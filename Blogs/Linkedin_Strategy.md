## LinkedIn Strategy Tips

You're spot-on with your approach. Here's a checklist based on your notes:

- ✅ Use alt text for every image (AI-generated if needed)
- ✅ Prefer landscape format; avoid empty chairs
- ✅ Encourage front-row seating at events
- ✅ Post every 3 days (not too frequently)
- ✅ Use medium/long-form text with relevant keywords
- ✅ Avoid links in post body — place them in comments
- ✅ Use emojis and AI-generated copy
- ✅ Mastodon: good for speaker/sponsor outreach, less for corporate visibility
