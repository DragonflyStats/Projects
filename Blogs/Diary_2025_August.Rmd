### Diary Entry – Father Russell Road, August 2025

Out walking again today, just to keep the steps up. No fish this time—just the quiet rhythm of Father Russell Road and Mungret. Deborah popped into my mind as I passed through; she used to jog here, and I still associate the place with her. Funny how certain routes hold memories.

Still a bit jet-lagged from the North America trip. The R Conference in North Carolina went really well—felt proud of how it all came together. Afterward, I spent a few days in Saratoga Springs with my cousin, then back to the buzz of New York City.

One standout moment: Waiting for Godot at the Hudson Theatre. Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter—yes, Bill and Ted—took on Beckett. Some are calling it Bill and Ted’s Existential Adventure. It was absurd, bleak, and hilarious. A strange joy.

Back home, things are shifting. I’m spending more time in Westmeath with the family. Mam is aging but still active. Dad’s waiting on a hip replacement, so he’s a bit slowed down. We’ve got two dogs keeping things lively. Minnie, the Scottish Terrier, rules the house with an iron paw. If she wants the couch, you move. If she wants a walk, you walk.

Tanzy’s recovering from a stroke. He’s mobile again, though he still fakes stair trouble so Dad will carry him to bed. He even snuck off down the road recently—came back on his own, then played helpless that night. Classic Tanzy.

The house situation’s been tricky. I’m living with two Ukrainian women—new arrivals—but they’re not getting along. One’s been especially difficult, and I’ve had to ask her to leave. It’s unfortunate, but necessary.

Still working with the forestry company. The usual rhythm, though the travel has thrown me off a bit.

Quick note: I’ve been using voice-to-text while walking, then tidying things up with Copilot. It’s efficient, though the tone sometimes feels a bit AI-polished. Minnie’s caught on—she now associates walks with phone calls and starts barking madly if anyone rings me at home. Pavlov would be proud.

Wondering how Deborah’s family is—her sister, brother, parents. Must check in properly soon.

—K.
