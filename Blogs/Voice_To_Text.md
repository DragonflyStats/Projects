## 🤖 Working with AI – Strategy & Tools

**Choosing an AI Client**:
- Some AI tools like Gemini and Copilot (consumer versions) are easy to use but not suitable for workplace environments.
- Microsoft Copilot Enterprise Edition is widely accepted in corporate settings due to its privacy safeguards—it does not use prompts for training.

**Prompt Strategy**:
- Prompts must be under 8,000 characters.
- I prepare detailed “context files” in advance, each focused on a specific subject area (e.g., databases, table names, column types, key variables).
- At the start of a project, I paste in 4–5 context files followed by 7–8 refinement prompts.
- Performance tends to degrade after a certain number of prompts, so I often reset the chat and start fresh for each work package.

**Editing & Productivity**:
- AI-generated text often requires manual editing. I use AI to tidy up drafts, then refine the output quickly.
- The “walk-and-talk” method is highly productive—by preparing small tasks in advance, I can generate substantial content during a one-hour walk.
- Discipline is key: avoid duplication, curate your outputs, and maintain clarity.
- With proper structure and editing, you can rapidly progress a project and build a substantial body of work.

 
### Voice to Text

When I'm at my family home, this is how I often spend the afternoon with my dog—wandering through the forest, visiting all her favorite spots. And me? I'm usually chatting away on my phone.

But lately, I’ve been using **Voice to Text live transcription** to capture those conversations in real time. Whether it’s a work call, a spontaneous idea, or a story I want to remember, transcription helps me stay present while keeping a record.

**Is it secure?**  
Yes—if you choose the right tools. Cybersecurity matters, especially when sensitive conversations are involved. Look for transcription platforms that offer:

- 🔐 **End-to-end encryption** (like TLS or AES-256)
- ✅ **Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, or ISO 27001**
- 🔒 **Two-factor authentication and access controls**

Trusted options include **Otter.ai**, **Rev**, **Trint**, **Sonix**, and **Transkriptor**, all of which prioritize data privacy and secure storage.
