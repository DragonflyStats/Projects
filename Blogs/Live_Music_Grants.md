- **Support live music in Ireland**, especially in rural areas.
- **Promote live music as a viable profession**.
- **Encourage the sustainability of rural pubs and hospitality venues**.

### Overview
Musicians will receive grants to perform in rural hospitality establishments. Venues will also be eligible for corresponding financial support to host live music events.

### Grant Use and Timing
- Grants can be applied on **quiet days of the week** such as Monday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
- The intention is to **stimulate activity in pubs during quieter periods**, improving their viability and helping rural communities thrive.

### Artist Development
- Young artists will benefit by:
  - Gaining **performance opportunities**.
  - Building **local followings**.
  - Refining their **live act and songbook**.
- Artists can still perform **larger concerts on weekends**, balancing career progression with grant-funded gigs during the week.

### Financial Considerations

  - **Transport costs**
  - **Musical equipment**
  - **Maintenance of instruments**, which can be costly
- This ensures the program supports the **strategic and long-term success** of participating musicians.

### Long-Term Vision
