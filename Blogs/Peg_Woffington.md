### Peg Woffington and the Dublin Theater Scene  

Anyone familiar with the nightlife of late-'90s Dublin may remember hearing the name Peg Woffington. At the time, little was widely known about her, and many mistakenly believed her name was Peg Wolfington.  

Among my generation, her name wasn’t particularly well-known—perhaps that’s just teenagers for you. But who exactly was Peg Woffington?  

For those with an interest in the performing arts, theater history, and the evolution of dramatic craft, her story is fascinating. Many in London will be familiar with the name David Garrick, whose legacy is scattered across Covent Garden—Garrick Street, The Garrick Club, The Garrick Bar, and The Garrick Restaurant, to name a few. He was one of the leading figures at Theatre Royal Drury Lane.  

However, this is not his story.  

By the 1870s, Covent Garden had ushered in a new generation of theater under the legendary influence of figures like Charles Macklin. The craft of theatrical performance was undergoing a revolution, and among those shaping this era was a young David Garrick.  

Before reaching the heights of his career in London, Garrick had worked at the Theatre Royal in Dublin, now known as Smock Alley Theatre, located at the eastern end of Temple Bar near Christchurch. At the time, Dublin was regarded as the second city of the British Isles, with one of the most active theater scenes in Britain and Ireland.  

It was in Dublin that Garrick presumably met Peg Woffington. She was older than him and likely a more experienced performer. This was the era of the mid-18th-century Shakespeare revival, with Macklin playing a key role in breathing new life into theatrical craft. It was an exhilarating time to be an actor, and Garrick was well-positioned to establish a lasting legacy—one that endures to this day.  

However, Woffington was equally deserving of recognition. She was, in many ways, his counterpart.  

When Garrick returned to London, Woffington accompanied him and became a celebrated performer in her own right. Sadly, the two grew estranged over time and eventually went their separate ways. Though she maintained a strong acting career, Woffington passed away at a young age. She is now buried in Teddington Cemetery in southwest London.  

Traces of her legacy remain—she is immortalized in a portrait displayed in Room 18 of the National Portrait Gallery in London, alongside Garrick and many other luminaries of the era. Also in that room is a portrait of Ira Aldridge, whom I find particularly fascinating.  

### The Actor’s Church in Covent Garden  

One of my favorite places in London is the Actor’s Church in Covent Garden, tucked away on the western side. It is somewhat inconspicuous to tourists, who usually see it only as the backdrop to street performers.  

With its imposing Gothic façade, it often blends into the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden. But step inside, and it is a delightful surprise.  

The church’s connection to the acting profession dates back to the mid-18th century, during the heyday of Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. To this day, it maintains its tradition of supporting the acting community.  

Each summer, young theater companies and emerging performers stage wonderful productions in the church garden, continuing a rich legacy of creativity.  

### In Praise of the Troubadour  

Whenever I speak with my uncle about his time in London’s SW5 district, I get the impression that South Kensington was a vastly different place in the 1960s and 1970s. He moved there as a young man at the tail end of the Swinging Sixties, when youth culture was truly flourishing.  

South Kensington felt vibrant and alive, with creativity at its core. Mary Quant had her boutique there, selling the latest in London fashion. Twiggy was a style icon, and King’s Road was where the trendsetters gathered.
