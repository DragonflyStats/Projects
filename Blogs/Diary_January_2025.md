Wrote to Debora this evening—it's been ages. I wished her a Happy New Year and asked where she's based now. I think she moved to Santiago de Compostela, though I’m not entirely sure.

Things are steady here in Door Doyle. For the past two and a half years, I shared the house with a group of Ukrainian women. At one point, there were four of them: I stayed downstairs, one took Debora’s old room, another the front room, and two shared the big room. It was quite the experience—lively, chaotic, and oddly comforting.

They’ve all moved on to new homes now, which means more space and, thankfully, more peace. I’m living alone again for the moment, fixing up the house and considering taking in students as tenants later this year.

Mam and Dad are doing well. Mam’s showing her age more than she did when Debora lived with us, but she’s still active and sharp.

The house is full of animals. We’ve got four dogs now. The newest addition is Minnie, a Scottish Terrier with a bark that could shatter glass. She’s louder than Dad can tolerate, so when she wants something, it’s best to just give in. I’ve even taken to walking them with my breakfast in hand—there’s no stopping her.

Townsi is still with us, though she’s getting older. My sister’s two dogs are here too—twin sisters, complete opposites. One’s loud and loves walks; the other barely moves and hates any form of activity. We thought something might be wrong with her, but apparently, it’s just her personality.

And then there’s the cat. This is the real twist. Mam hated cats for 45 years—absolutely forbade them in the house. But this one had other ideas. She slowly worked her way in, claimed her spot, and now lives like royalty. Her throne? A little tent perched on top of the fridge, where she watches us all like a queen surveying her court.

Funny how things change.
