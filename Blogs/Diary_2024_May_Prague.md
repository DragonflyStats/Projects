**Prague Notes: Cafés, Clubs, and Quiet Walks**

My usual meeting spot with my uncle in Prague was a café once called Pod Lipidum. In 2025, it changed ownership and is now called Ubuntu. It’s a lovely little place—friendly staff, accommodating atmosphere, and ideally located. Whether I was arriving in Prague on the morning flight from Dublin or staying in Malá Strana, it was easy to reach by tram. Sometimes I’d walk instead, heading up through Letná Park. That route offered a panoramic view of Prague and the Charles Bridge—a perfect moment for quiet contemplation.

The café is near Letná Stadium, home of Sparta Prague. Their distinctive burgundy jerseys have always appealed to me. On match days, the local bar would be packed with Sparta supporters—boisterous, well-mannered, and full of enthusiasm. I’ve developed a soft spot for Sparta over the years and still keep an eye on their European results. I think I have an old replica jersey from 1999 tucked away somewhere at home.

Strangely enough, if I had to choose a Prague team to support, it wouldn’t be Sparta—despite my fondness. I’ve always been amused and impressed by Slavia Prague’s history. They’re named after Café Slavia in the city, which adds a poetic touch. I’ve never visited their stadium, but I’ve seen supporters wearing the jersey on match days.

In Ireland, it’s common to wear sports jerseys casually, but I’ve noticed it’s less so in Prague—perhaps just in the areas I stay.

I’ve also spent time in Prague 7, near Viktoria Žižkov’s ground. It’s a small stadium, seating around 6,000, which surprised me given their history in European football.

But if I were to pick one Prague team to support, it would have to be Bohemians. Their backstory is delightfully eccentric, and I couldn’t resist the charm. They even have a kangaroo mascot—a nod to their tour of Australia in the 1920s.
