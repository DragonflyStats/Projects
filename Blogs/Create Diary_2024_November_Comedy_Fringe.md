In late November 2024, I travelled to Prague for the Comedy Fringe Festival. I’d been to Prague many times before, but this trip truly sealed my love affair with the city.

It was a short visit, and I stayed at The King Charles Hotel near the castle. The hotel was wonderfully luxurious—typically expensive in summer, but surprisingly affordable in the winter months. Even the high-end options around the castle seemed much cheaper. I was genuinely delighted by the quality of the room.

The Prague Comedy Fringe Festival took place across four venues in central Prague. One was the enchanting Museum of Alchemists, just around the corner from my hotel. Another was the Metro OG Comedy Club. And then there was the Charles Bridge Comedy Club—a venue that deserves special mention.

An eerie, cavernous basement bar. A sight to behold.

There’s nothing more magical than Prague in November, especially when comedy and Gothic horror are on offer.
