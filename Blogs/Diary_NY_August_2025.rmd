 
*Saturday Evening*

Safely back at my family home in Kabixi, nestled in the center of Ireland. The flight over was smooth—no turbulence, no delays—and the airport experience was surprisingly convenient. I breezed through customs and TSA, and having lounge access made the wait all the more comfortable. Jet lag is setting in now, so I’ll head to bed soon.

The journey from Albany to Saratoga to Penn Station was pleasant. The train was fairly full, but everything ran smoothly. At the New Yorker Hotel, I was lucky—they let me check in early, around 1 p.m., which gave me a few extra hours to enjoy the city.

I wandered over to the Hudson Theatre near Times Square to look for merchandise from *Waiting for Godot*. No luck on gifts, but I did stumble into a dive bar across the street and met a few Irish carpenters—Big Dennis from Tyrone and Sawdust Mikey, whose accent has nearly vanished after so many years in the States. (Not to be confused with Chainsaw Mikey or Yonkers Mikey, of course.)

Later, I met up with a friend and we visited the Whitney Museum—still one of my favorite places in New York. Friday nights are free, so we took our time exploring. My friend works at a conference in Durham, and afterward, we headed to the Hotel Chelsea for a drink. The contrast between Jimmy’s Corner and the Chelsea was stark, but that’s the charm of New York—so many layers, so many lives.

The next morning, I started early with breakfast at La Bonbonniere, a classic old-school diner near the Meatpacking District. I met up with my cousin Liam, and we spent the day exploring. One highlight was The Frying Pan, a bar on a pier along the Hudson River near 202nd Street. The sun was out, the cocktails were fruity, and I even managed to get a bit of sunburn.

After collecting my bags from the hotel, Liam brought me out to JFK via the Long Island Railway. It was impressively quick and efficient. Since we had time to spare, we visited the TWA Hotel—a 1960s airline-themed gem right in the middle of the airport. It’s beautifully designed and well worth a short visit if you’re ever passing through JFK.

Time to rest now. More soon.
