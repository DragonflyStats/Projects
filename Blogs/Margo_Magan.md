Certainly, Kevin. Here's a revised version of the post in the past tense, honoring Margo Magan’s legacy with a respectful and factual tone:

🏊‍♀️🇮🇪 *Remembering Margo Magan and the Beckett Legacy*

Margo Magan (née Beckett), who passed away recently in her 92nd year, was a remarkable figure in Irish sport and part of a distinguished family heritage. The daughter of Jim and Peggy Beckett, Margo held multiple national swimming titles in the mid-1940s and continued swimming well into her later years—remarkably, up to her 90th birthday.

She was a cousin of Samuel Beckett, the Nobel Prize-winning playwright, and their connection reflected a quiet but enduring bond rooted in shared values and family resilience.

Her father, James Beckett (1884–1971), was a celebrated Irish athlete. He captained the Irish water polo team at the 1924 Paris Olympics and competed nationally in swimming and diving. He also played rugby for Old Wesley in the 1909 Senior Cup and represented Leinster in cricket and boxing. Despite becoming a double leg amputee later in life, Jim Beckett remained a symbol of perseverance and strength—qualities that resonated with both Margo and Samuel.

Margo’s life was defined by grace, determination, and a pioneering spirit. She broke barriers as the first female president of a golf club in Ireland and carried forward the Beckett legacy with quiet dignity. Her story stands as a testament to the enduring power of family, sport, and Irish heritage.
