Diary Entry — Algonquin Afternoon (Expanded)

Slipped into the Algonquin Hotel just after noon, the lobby humming with a quiet kind of elegance—velvet chairs, soft jazz, and the faint scent of old paper and polish. I’d come chasing ghosts, really. Dorothy Parker’s wit, Benchley’s barbs, the Round Table’s echoes still lingering in the woodwork.

Ordered a coffee I didn’t need just to linger longer. And then, as if summoned by some literary incantation, the hotel’s resident cat padded into view. Hamlet, they call him—sleek, aloof, and clearly aware he’s part of the legend. He hopped onto the arm of my chair, gave me a look that suggested he’d read my soul and found it mildly amusing, then settled in like we’d known each other for years.

It’s hard not to feel the weight of history here. The walls have listened to conversations between William Faulkner and Maya Angelou, seen Tennessee Williams scribble notes between drinks, and watched Harpo Marx play silent mischief in the lounge. Even the elevators seem to carry whispers from bygone eras.

I scribbled a few lines in my notebook, half hoping Hamlet would critique them. He didn’t. Just blinked slowly, like a feline editor withholding judgment.

Left feeling oddly buoyant. The Algonquin isn’t just a hotel—it’s a portal. And Hamlet? He’s the gatekeeper.

—K.
