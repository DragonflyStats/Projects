### **Thinking About R Communities**

Today, my mind keeps drifting back to the R communities that have been such a big part of my life, especially **DublinR** and **LondonR**. While I was the one who founded and often single-handedly ran DublinR, it's the LondonR community that I truly feel a deeper connection to. It might be because, in my opinion, their event format was the best of any R meetup I've ever seen.

Unlike DublinR, which was more frequent, LondonR opted for a quarterly schedule, which gave each event a mini-conference feel and a greater impact. The format was incredibly smart:

* **Afternoon:** The day started with a three-hour workshop, focusing on key R tools like **ggplot2**, **tidyverse**, **Shiny**, and **Quarto**.
* **Evening:** This was followed by the main meetup talks, running from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.
* **Late Night:** The evening wrapped up with informal networking over drinks.

This structure was a brilliant move. It made it worth it for people to travel, turning it into a real day out. I was already based in London, but I remember people coming from all over the UK—from the West Country to Norfolk—and staying until 11 p.m. or later before heading home.

A huge part of their success was the partnership with **Mango Solutions**. They didn't just sponsor the events and provide free drinks; they were also incredibly active in recruiting speakers, including me. They had a real knack for finding talented local R users and organizing high-quality, relevant talks.

It's amazing to think about how much the meetup grew. We went from a tiny bar basement near Liverpool Street Station to a huge space at Balls Brothers on Mincing Lane. That move really reflected the community’s growing size and confidence. It was a special time, and it makes me appreciate the power of a well-organized and supportive community.
