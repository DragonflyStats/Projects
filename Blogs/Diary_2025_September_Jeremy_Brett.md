On September 12, 2015, the world marked the 30th anniversary of Jeremy Brett’s passing. While it remains unclear whether any official commemorations took place, a likely tribute is the memorial bench in Clapham Common, situated near the bandstand and a small shop just north of it. 

Sherlock Holmes experienced a resurgence in popularity in the early 2010s, largely due to the success of the BBC’s *Sherlock*. This led to a perceived rivalry between *Sherlock* and CBS’s *Elementary*, which starred Jonny Lee Miller—my personal favorite. Additionally, the *Sherlock Holmes* films starring Robert Downey Jr., though theatrical and extravagant, were undeniably entertaining.

I followed all of these adaptations closely, although my enthusiasm waned after *Sherlock’s* second season.

In contrast, Jeremy Brett’s portrayal of Holmes in *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes*, which aired on Granada Television from the 1980s to 1990s, remains iconic. The series produced 41 episodes, six of which were feature-length at approximately 90 minutes each.

Many consider Brett to be the quintessential Holmes—a calculating and precise man who concealed a volatile intensity beneath his composed exterior. In many ways, this portrayal reflected Brett himself, as he struggled with addiction throughout his life—a factor that contributed to his early passing. Nevertheless, he left behind a lasting and compelling legacy.

The Granada *Sherlock Holmes* series is particularly notable for its authenticity and faithful adaptations of Arthur Conan Doyle’s original stories. While some episodes combined two short stories or modified certain locations—bringing foreign settings closer to home—the core intrigue of the narratives remained intact.
