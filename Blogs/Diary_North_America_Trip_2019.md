What a whirlwind! The past few weeks have been a blur of travel, and I'm finally getting a moment to sit down and write about it all. The plan seemed so simple on paper, but executing it has been an adventure in itself.

It all started with my Aer Lingus flight to New York. The flight was smooth, and I even managed to get a little bit of work done. But the real "pinch me" moment was landing at JFK. Getting through customs was quick, thankfully, because I had printed out my ESTA paperwork, and that felt like a win. Then it was on to the AirTrain, a little metal snake winding its way through the airport, carrying me to the subway system. Finding my way to The Jane in the Meatpacking District was a bit of a puzzle, but with a combination of Google Maps and a little bit of street-level observation, I finally made it. The hotel itself is so charming, with its unique "cabin" rooms, and being so close to places like the Whitney Museum and Kobrick Coffee Co. made it the perfect base. It was definitely the right choice for a short, initial stay.

The next leg was all about JuliaCon 2018. I was so excited to be a part of the conference. After checking out of The Jane, I made my way to Penn Station to catch the train to Baltimore. The journey was beautiful, a nice change of pace from the city bustle. Once in Baltimore, I had to figure out how to get to the Crowne Plaza hotel. A quick search revealed that the Baltimore Light Rail was the way to go. It was a straightforward trip, and the hotel was lovely. Having the JuliaCon ticket printout was a lifesaver, and the schedule was a constant companion in my pocket. The talks were fantastic, and I met so many interesting people. The community is so welcoming and passionate.

As quickly as it began, it was time for the next leg of the journey. The flight to Canada was smooth. I had applied for my Canada eTA beforehand, which made crossing the border a breeze. Montreal is such a beautiful city! I found a bus from the airport to my hotel, and navigating the public transport system there was surprisingly easy. The hotel was comfortable and in a great location.

My last big travel day was the most scenic. I was so excited for the Adirondack train from Montreal to New York. I got directions to the train station in Montreal, and the journey itself was breathtaking. We passed through historic towns like Saratoga Springs, and the views of the Hudson Valley and the Adirondack Mountains were incredible. It felt like a movie. The best part? I was headed back to The Jane! My second stay there was just as good as the first, and it felt like a little home away from home.

And now, here I am, packing up for the final leg. The flight home to Ireland is booked. I'm exhausted, but my head is full of new ideas, and my heart is full of gratitude for this incredible experience. I can't wait to see what adventures lie ahead, but for now, it's time to go home.
