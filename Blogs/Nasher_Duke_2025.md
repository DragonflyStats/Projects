Here’s a polished and integrated version that seamlessly incorporates all those works into the broader narrative of the Nasher Museum’s collection:

---

The **Nasher Museum of Art** at Duke University in Durham, NC, is a dynamic center for global contemporary art, with over 13,000 works that amplify voices historically sidelined in major institutions. Through bold acquisitions and curatorial innovation, the museum fosters conversations around identity, equity, and cultural memory.

Among its signature pieces is **Jaune Quick-to-See Smith’s** *Fifty Shades of White*, a sharply layered critique of colonialism and cultural erasure, emblematic of the Nasher’s commitment to Indigenous perspectives.

The museum also showcases major works from renowned artists such as:

- **Archibald Motley**, whose *Hot Rhythm* (1961) captures the vibrance of African American nightlife with jazz-infused energy  
- **Roy Lichtenstein**, represented by *Washington Crossing the Delaware II* (1951), a satirical reinterpretation of American history painting, recently gifted by the Lichtenstein Foundation in honor of the artist’s centennial  
- **Hugo McCloud**, whose *push pull* (2019) transforms industrial materials like plastic bags and roofing paper into textured abstract canvases that challenge traditional notions of beauty and worth  
- **Michelangelo Lovelace**, whose poignant street scene *You Have the Right to Remain Silent* (2013) explores racial dynamics, urban life, and social justice amid the legacy of the Black Lives Matter movement  
- **David Burliuk**, a Russian Futurist and labor advocate, whose Social Realist painting *Shame to All but to the Dead* (1933) mourns the suffering of the Great Depression while critiquing capitalist excess

These works stand alongside celebrated pieces by:

- **Barkley L. Hendricks** – Stylized portraits that honor Black identity  
- **Nina Chanel Abney** – Explosive, pop-culture-infused critiques of race and politics  
- **Amy Sherald** – Dreamlike depictions of African American life, including echoes of her Michelle Obama portrait  
- **Christian Marclay** – Media montages like *Telephones* that remix cinematic dialogue  
- **Wangechi Mutu** – Collaged figures confronting femininity and post-colonialism  
- Plus pivotal voices like **Kerry James Marshall**, **Kara Walker**, **Hank Willis Thomas**, **Lorna Simpson**, **Mickalene Thomas**, and **Theaster Gates**

Designed by Rafael Viñoly, the museum’s striking architecture provides the perfect canvas for rotating exhibitions that engage with environmental justice, activism, and identity. At the Nasher, art isn’t just displayed—it’s ignited.

**Roy Lichtenstein’s *Washington Crossing the Delaware II* (1951)** is a satirical reinterpretation of the iconic American Revolutionary scene. Painted early in Lichtenstein’s career, this oil-on-canvas work subverts traditional history painting with a deadpan, cartoon-like aesthetic that foreshadows his later Pop Art style. By parodying heroic imagery, Lichtenstein critiques the mythologizing of national history and invites viewers to reconsider the visual language of patriotism.

**Hugo McCloud’s *push pull* (2019)** is a striking mixed-media piece composed entirely of repurposed plastic merchandise bags on wood panel. The work depicts two silhouetted figures loading bananas or plantains onto a bicycle, evoking themes of labor, trade, and resilience. McCloud’s use of industrial waste materials challenges conventional notions of beauty and value, while highlighting the inequities of global commerce and the physical toll of survival in developing economies.

**Michelangelo Lovelace’s *You Have the Right to Remain Silent* (2013)** captures a bustling Cleveland street scene layered with social commentary. Through vivid acrylics and deep perspective, Lovelace portrays a diverse urban community alongside symbols of policing and protest. A mural of police cars, phrases like “just-us,” and a Biblical billboard juxtapose the everyday with the systemic, making the painting a poignant reflection on racial injustice and the enduring impact of the Black Lives Matter movement.

**David Burliuk’s *Shame to All but to the Dead* (1933)** is a monumental Social Realist canvas critiquing the devastation of the Great Depression. The painting features a shantytown of unemployed workers, the lifeless body of Diogenes the Cynic, and a desolate New York skyline. Burliuk’s composition blends classical symbolism with political urgency, condemning the waste and neglect of capitalist society. His accompanying manifesto underscores the painting’s radical message: that in a world of abundance and suffering, only the dead escape shame.
