November 2024, Part One: My Trip to North America

I timed my visit to coincide with Pay Data New York in November—excellent timing, I thought, for a return to North America. I checked my travel box and decided it was feasible.

I’d long been curious about the castles scattered across the Northeast U.S., and this trip offered a good opportunity to catch up with a few of them. Strangely enough, I found myself feeling quite at home during my time in North America.

I had some intelligence work scheduled on the day of the U.S. election, but my plan to stay in Saratoga Springs fell through—the facility wasn’t available due to election-related disruptions. So I pivoted and headed to New York City on Friday, staying at Leo House on 23rd Street and 8th Avenue. I had a great chat with the staff there, touching on Archibald Motley, Horus, and Jacob Lawrence.

From there, I made my way to Philadelphia. I saw the Rocky statue and arrived just as a big race was taking place—chaotic but energizing. I collected my things and checked into my hotel at Penn Landing. Nice place.

Later, I grabbed a taxi to the concert venue to see The Go! Team again. Excellent gig—great energy, even if the turnout wasn’t huge. The boss was there. I really enjoyed it. In fact, I’ve come to really like Philadelphia as a result of this visit.

Oddly enough, I ran into some of the band members again—third time now. They’re starting to look at me a bit suspiciously.
