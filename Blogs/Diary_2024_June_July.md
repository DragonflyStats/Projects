Diary Entry – June/July2024
What finally nudged me to write today was a small but satisfying victory at work: we’ve finally figured out how to do CRON jobs. It’s taken us about 7 or 8 months to get there, which is wild considering the whole thing really kicked off last October when I was chatting with Mikel about it. That conversation was the seed, and now—finally—we’ve got the system in place. I should tell him. His reaction will probably be something like, “Jesus Christ, is he serious?”

On a more scenic note, I was in Prague recently for the Fringe Festival. I lucked out with a gorgeous apartment near the castle—ridiculously good rate—and spent the week working Front of House in these charming little cellar theatres tucked around the old buildings near Prague Castle. I’d gone last year thinking it’d be a once-off, but it was so good I went back again this year… and somehow had an even better time.

That said, I’m mostly done with travelling for now. I’ve got a short trip to Edinburgh planned for August, but I’ve spent a small fortune over the past year—two trips to the USA, two to the UK with Mum—so I’m calling it. The rest of 2024 will be for mowing lawns, walking dogs, and planting trees. I’ve collected a heap of acorns recently, and the first set of saplings are finally ready for permanent planting.

Also, my Aunt and Cousins are over from the States, so there’s been a flurry of family gatherings in Mullingar. Thankfully, I don’t have to go to all of them.
