Just to review my annual leave days:

I took two days in March when I went to Glasgow.

I took five days at the end of May for my trip to Prague. However, Iâ€™d like to revert one of those days, as I attended the SRG meeting and handled other matters during the mornings.

In August, I took annual leave from Wednesday, August 6th to Friday, August 15th.

I was actually on duty on the Tuesday between the bank holiday and my leave. I had a meeting with Stephen Fletcher and also handled calls and emails to ITD.
