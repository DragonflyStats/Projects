**Stem Profiling**  

Stem profiling in forestry involves the detailed analysis and description of a tree stem based on measurements obtained from logs cut by harvesting machines. This process records attributes such as diameter at various heights, total height, and volume. Stem profiling helps assess timber quality and value and supports informed decisions in forest management and harvesting operations.

**Data Collection**  

Accurate predictions require thorough data collection, including the following variables:  

- **Timber Measurements**: Key data for individual trees, such as Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), tree height, volume, and other critical metrics.  
- **Top Height**: The primary variable to predict, which can be measured directly using specialized equipment or estimated through aerial imagery.
