Stand Classification Project

This program is designed to create a Stand classification database. 
It utilizes inventory sub compartment information, including subcompartments from the SubCompartment Database and YTGen sources.

📐 It incorporates slope and elevation data.

💾 The SubCompartment Database is housed on the Coillte system.  
🔎 Check under the PBI con.  
📁 Review older versions of the Subcompartment Database stored on the shared drive.

📊 The output table should include a snapshot base to support multiple versions of the same subcompartment, timestamped for version control.

📂 This project will be added to the 17-stand classification database.  
⚙️ Series and yield-related Shiny app scripts will be deprecated.

📌 This is part of the redesign of Panel 4 in the Shiny app and will contribute to the presentation in the SRG.
