### Growth and Yield Modelling

This project was initiated in the winter of 2024, with most of the progress made during Q1 of 2025. The objective is to review the code base underpinning the yield forecasting model and convert it into a documented code framework that we can maintain internally. The goal is also to ensure the skills base required for this system is permanently retained within the company.

SIX is now a mature data analytics system. The quality of the data has reached a sufficient standard where meaningful business analytics can be performed. For example, we’ve used it successfully in the context of windblow analysis.

Work has also been done to better understand how various estimates are generated in LRM, which helped us establish a much-improved framework for understanding the interaction between our various data sources.


### Generic YTGen Yield Requests

Earlier this year, we restarted documentation on the process behind running a generic YTGen unit request. This step is valuable because it lets us simulate how forecasts are generated using YT-Gen, an essential part of our forecasting systems. The process has now been streamlined and clearly documented, making it straightforward to run a generic YT yield request.

There was significant prior work done around States, but a key focus this year has been on examining spatial overlaps—for example, how a STIX footprint intersects with the designated footprint of a harvest unit, as defined by LRM. This comparison now gives us more accurate and like-for-like analytical results for STIX data.

We’re also able to generate highly refined analyses for cutting strategies that take into account operational and environmental constraints.
