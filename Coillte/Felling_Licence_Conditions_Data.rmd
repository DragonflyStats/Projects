### **Felling License Applications and AI-Assisted Processing**  

When a stand-up forestry is planned for harvesting—whether as a clear fell or a thinning—a felling license application must be submitted to the Irish Department of Agriculture and Marine. This application contains essential environmental information and serves as a functional equivalent to planning permission for a building.  

Thousands of these applications are submitted annually, each corresponding to a specific forestry site. A submission typically includes:  
- Locational data  
- Environmental Assessment reports  
- Details regarding compliance with the Mature 2000 Impact Statement requirement  

If an application is successful, an approved felling license is issued. This license comes with a set of conditions, many of which are standard, such as compliance with existing regulations. Some conditions, however, are time-sensitive and require immediate attention—such as notifications to national parks or other key environmental bodies.  

At the highest priority level, time-sensitive applications must be detected as soon as possible.

### **Developing an AI-Based Mechanism for Detection**  

We are working on a mechanism to automatically identify high-priority applications.  

1. **Document Processing**  
   - Felling license applications are submitted in PDF format, which, while structured, varies slightly in formatting.  
   - These PDFs can be converted into Notepad files to allow for rapid text processing.  

2. **Keyword Parsing**  
   - Each document is scanned and transformed into a structured impact report.  
   - Keywords such as *otter* and *Berlin* are used to flag environmental concerns and regulatory requirements.  

3. **Leveraging AI for Enhanced Processing**  
   - Currently, our AI capability is **Microsoft Copilot**, which excels at handling burst queries.  
   - However, for this use case, we need to process massive amounts of information—potentially **hundreds of pages per document**.

### **Challenges with Microsoft Copilot and Alternative Strategies**  

Despite its usefulness, Microsoft Copilot has certain limitations:  
- **Input Constraints:** The dialog box is limited to **8,000 characters**, which is insufficient for processing extensive documents.  
- **Limited Memory:** Conversations do not persist, meaning previous queries cannot be recalled within a chat.  

To address these limitations, our strategy involves:  
- Storing felling license text documents in a **central repository** for structured analysis.  
- Successively reading and processing these documents using AI-driven contextual agents.  
- Incorporating **specialized jargon, operational lexicons, and reference ID interpretations**, such as county codes linked to specific Irish regions.  

By refining this AI-driven approach, we aim to automate the detection of high-priority felling license applications, ensuring timely responses and regulatory compliance.
