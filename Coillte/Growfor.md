The Growfor model is a specialized forestry growth and yield prediction tool, primarily designed to assist with forest management planning. It uses a mathematical framework to project how forests grow over time based on environmental conditions and silvicultural practices. Here's an outline of how it works:

### **Inputs**
The Growfor model typically requires specific types of data, including:
1. **Site Characteristics**: Soil type, climate data, elevation, and other environmental factors that influence forest growth.
2. **Species Information**: Tree species composition, age, and initial stand conditions like diameter and height.
3. **Management Interventions**: Details on thinning, pruning, and planting density.
4. **Historical Data**: Past growth rates or yield data for calibration, if available.

### **Outputs**
The outputs of the Growfor model generally include:
1. **Growth Predictions**: Height, diameter, and volume growth over time for individual trees or the forest stand.
2. **Yield Estimates**: Total timber volume, biomass, or other products like carbon sequestration potential.
3. **Stand Dynamics**: Changes in tree competition, mortality rates, and stand density over time.
4. **Impact of Management**: Projections showing how specific interventions, like thinning, influence growth and yield.
