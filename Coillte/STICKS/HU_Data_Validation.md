1. **Compile a list of operations** that meet either of the following criteria:
   - Assigned to more than one forest
   - Associated with more than one logging unit  
   
   This analysis should be performed across the following datasets:
   - Logs data  
   - Stems data  
   - Harvest area data  

2. **Identify harvest units** that do **not conform** to the standard operation notation format. The required format is:
   - Four characters  
   - A hyphen (`-`)  
   - The letter `H`  
   - Followed by four digits  
   
   Example of valid format: `ABCD-H1234`  
   - Total length: 10 characters  
   - Character 5: hyphen (`-`)  
   - Character 6: letter `H`  

   For any harvest unit that does **not** follow this format, report the associated logging unit and forest.
