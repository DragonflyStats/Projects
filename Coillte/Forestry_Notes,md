A cutting strategy typically refers to a systematic approach to reducing costs or optimizing resources within an organization. It involves identifying areas where expenses can be minimized without compromising the quality of products, services, or overall operations. For example, companies might streamline processes, reduce waste, or adopt more efficient technologies as part of their cutting strategy.

Would you like to explore specific examples or applications of cutting strategies?

In forestry and log bucking, a **cutting strategy** refers to the method used to cut felled trees into logs of specific lengths and sizes to maximize their value and utility. This process involves careful planning to ensure that the logs meet the requirements of sawmills or other end-users while minimizing waste.

Key considerations in a cutting strategy include:
- **Log Lengths**: Determining the optimal lengths for logs based on market demand and mill specifications.
- **Tree Features**: Accounting for natural features like knots, branches, or defects to maximize usable wood.
- **Value Optimization**: Using tools or software to calculate the most profitable way to cut a tree into logs.
- **Sustainability**: Ensuring that the cutting process aligns with sustainable forestry practices, preserving the health of the ecosystem.

Timber product forecasting models are typically based on a combination of the following inputs:  
1. Tree species  
2. Age  
3. Top height  
4. Diameter at breast height  

REMSOFT forecasting software can model timber product outputs, providing a breakdown of timber products into categories such as large sawlogs, small sawlogs, pulpwood, stakewood, and harvest losses.
