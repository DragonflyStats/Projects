Accessing SharePoint Excel Files in R
Hi there,

The objective of this workflow is to securely access and read an Excel file stored in a SharePoint Online folder directly into the R programming environment using the {Microsoft365R} package.

To do this, you'll need to authenticate with Microsoft 365 and connect to your SharePoint site. If you're unsure about managing access protocols, don't worry — this guide walks through each step clearly.

📦 Step 1: Install Required Packages
r
# Install and load the Microsoft365R package
install.packages("Microsoft365R")
library(Microsoft365R)

# You’ll also need readxl to read Excel files
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
🔐 Step 2: Authenticate with Microsoft 365
When you call any function from {Microsoft365R} for the first time, it will prompt you to sign in through your web browser. This uses Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication, and your credentials will be cached for later use.

🌐 Step 3: Access SharePoint Site and Document Library
r
# Replace with your actual SharePoint site URL
site <- get_sharepoint_site(site_url = "https://your_tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/your_site")

# Access the specific SharePoint document library
library <- site$get_drive("your_library")
📥 Step 4: Download and Read the Excel File
r
# Specify the path to your Excel file
file <- library$get_item("path/to/your_file.xlsx")

# Download to a temporary location
temp_file <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")
file$download(temp_file)

# Read the file into R
data <- read_excel(temp_file)

# Preview the data
print(data)
This setup enables seamless integration between SharePoint and R, keeping your workflows reproducible and secure.

Would you like to convert this into a downloadable handout, or package it up into a Quarto PDF report with visuals? I can help with that too.
