#### Why do I need to write an FAQ section?
I absolutely need an FAQ section because I cant go anywhere without being asked these questions. 
Just the other day, I was down in Tescos supermarket when a staff member walked up to me and asked me what my favourite R package was.
I didn't even make it to the check-out before some staff member asked me where in the world I was based.
That question was slightly unexpected as he lives a few doors down from me. 
Nonetheless, my public has a right to know, and I will not leave them wanting for answers.

#### How come I know so many Supermarket workers. 
By the standards of the quiet suburb that I live in, well stocked with children and small yappy dogs, being on a conversational 
basis with three or more retail workers constitutes a hectic social life. 
Also I am type of customer that arrives in at ten minutes before closing time, and proceeds to casually amble from aisle to aisle prevaricating over 
what I am in the mood for at that particular moment. That sort of behaviour tends to stick in the mind of retail staff coming to the end of their shift.

#### Am I a Python Genius?
Not even remotely. My knowledge of Python is fairly confined to NumPy, pandas and scikit learn. 
I know a reasonable amount about graphics packages too, but I dont use them often.
Fundamentally I am a mathematician/statistician, and not a developer in the conventional sense.

#### Am I a dog person or a cat person?
Honestly I am a dog person, but I get on very well with most cats. 
My neighbour's cat loves visiting my house, sometimes to assess the quality of my cooking, other times with a view to injuring me.

#### Where I am in the Language Wars?
SQL. Not enough people know about SQL and database servers (including me). Leaving SQL aside, there is an abundance of opinions on why one is better than another. Some make good points.
When you pose the questiont to someone who really knows the area - you would get very non-committal answers as to what language is best. Nearly ever answer is qualified
by the language being best for a particular use case. 
Dont do language wars, folks. It is a waste of your time, and you never make yourself look good in the long run.

Delighted to! Here are some humorous answers to go with the questions I suggested—keeping in line with your dry wit and self-deprecating charm:

---

### 🧠 What’s the most underrated statistical concept?

**Heteroscedasticity.** Not because it’s useful, but because saying it correctly makes you sound like you know what you’re doing. Bonus points if you can say it three times fast without summoning a demon.

---

### 📦 What’s your favourite R package?

Whichever one doesn’t break when I update R. So, none of them.

---

### 🧃 What’s your go-to snack while coding?

A delicate balance of tea, toast, and despair. Occasionally upgraded to crisps if the code compiles on the first try (which it never does).

---

### 🧮 What’s the weirdest dataset you’ve ever worked with?

A spreadsheet tracking the frequency of my neighbour’s cat visits. It peaked during a particularly bad lentil curry phase.

---

### 🧢 What’s your most controversial data opinion?

Pie charts are fine. There, I said it. Sometimes you just want your data to look like dessert.

---

### 🧳 Have you ever used statistics while travelling?

Yes. I once calculated the probability of making a connecting flight at Heathrow with a 45-minute layover. It was 0.0003. I made it. Barely.

---

### 🧘 How do you unwind after a long day of data wrangling?

I like to stare blankly at the wall while contemplating the futility of trying to merge two datasets with slightly different date formats.

---

### 🧙‍♂️ If you could magically master one programming language overnight, what would it be?

Whichever one is currently trending on Hacker News and making everyone else feel inadequate. Probably Rust. Or Klingon.

---

Want me to format these into your FAQ style? Or add a few more that lean even harder into the absurd?

#### Why did I start Dragonfly Statistics.
The truth is that it started off as a fake company that I put in my LinkedIn profile to make myself 
look better, adding a bit of start-up hipster chic to what is otherwise a very incoherent career history.
After a while, it turned into a real corporate entity, with Tax and VAT and accountancy fees.
I never earned enough to leave off it alone.
