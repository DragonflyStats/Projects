Mapp and Lucia Synopsis - Feeling a little under the weather a couple of weeks ago, I decided I needed something to cheer me up. E. F. Benson’s much-loved novel Mapp and Lucia seemed an excellent choice. I didn’t expect to have such a peculiar reading experience though. Mapp and Lucia has been on my piles for ages and ever since I got it, I saw people mention it as a novel they loved. When I mentioned on Twitter that I was planning to read it, the reactions were enthusiastic. Logically, I was sure, I would love it but for the first hundred pages I did not only not love it, I almost hated it. And then, I still don’t know why, I started to like it so much, that I still miss reading it. I believe that’s what some people call a book hangover. At the beginning of the novel, we find Lucia and her best-friend Georgie, still in Riseholm, where Lucia owns the most beautiful house and occupies the centre of the social life. That is, she did before her husband died. While he’s been dead for over a year, Lucia felt it was her duty to still live like a recluse. But enough is enough and she’s planning to re-enter Riseholm’s social life and be its queen again. Georgie who missed her shenanigans, is happy that she’s finally back. We’re led to believe that her mourning was only in part real, a lot of it was just for show. And so are most things with Lucia. She does and says so much just for show and to grab the attention of the people around her. One of the funniest things she does for show, is pretending that she speaks Italian. She addresses Georgie, and other people, constantly with little Italian sentences and phrases, exclaims her joy or distaste in Italian morsels. The people of Riseholm and Tilling admire and envy her for that. After reclaiming the Riseholm stage, Lucia is soon bored and wishes to conquer new territory. She decides to rent Mallard, the most beautiful house in Tilling. The house belongs to Miss Mapp, the centre of Tilling’s social life. Just like Lucia, she’s an attention-grabber, self-centred to the max, and never shies away from thinking about her own advantage. It’s the custom amongst the Tilling upper middle-class to sublet their homes in summer. Mallard being the most expensive one, it’s rented to foreigners; the next in line, Diva’s house, is taken by Miss Mapp. Diva rents someone else’s, and so on. Luckily for Lucia, Georgie decides to rent Mallard cottage and join her for the summer. He will prove, once more, to be her most ardent ally. At first, things are amicable enough, but soon Lucia isn’t satisfied anymore and wants to become the centre of Tilling. Things are a bit different here though. While there was no real competition for her in Riseholm, there’s formidable Miss Mapp in Tilling to be reckoned with. She’s the most important person in Tilling and there’s nothing that she doesn’t preside over, nothing she doesn’t decide, much to the annoyance of some of the other inhabitants of Tilling. Lucia might always have wanted to become Tilling’s most influential person, but having competition spurs her on even more. In Miss Mapp, she’s found her match. While things don’t often turn out the way Miss Mapp has planned, she still wins more than one small skirmish in this war. As I said, initially, I hated the book because I found the characters obnoxious and nasty. But once the reader gets to see behind Lucia’s mask and Miss Mapp defeats her more than once, it’s more and more enjoyable. And there’s life at Tilling. A carefree life that’s so different from most of our lives nowadays. Not only because it’s set before WWII, but because it’s set among the British upper middleclass. Nobody works in this book. All the main characters own beautiful houses. All they think about is, where they will dine next, who gives the best tea party. Gossip and petty quarrels aside, it’s a peaceful world. The conflicts are entirely the character’s own making. Nothing dramatic ever comes from outside. At least not until the end. After a while, I found spending time in this world very comforting. And funny. It’s a terrific social comedy. Lucia’s pretence to know Italian is hilarious and so is the way they constantly try to outsmart each other.
You’ve captured the charm of Mapp and Lucia beautifully! It sounds like quite the rollercoaster reading experience—going from near-hatred to full-on book hangover is a fascinating journey. It’s interesting how Benson plays with the absurdity of social ambition, pretension, and rivalry in a way that makes even the most exasperating characters strangely endearing. Lucia’s faux Italian antics and Miss Mapp’s strategic plotting create such a delicious dynamic.

Your point about the idyllic, insular world of Tilling is especially striking—no real work, just tea parties, gossip, and status maneuvers. It feels almost like stepping into a time capsule of the British upper middle class, where the stakes are grand but only within the self-contained universe of social posturing.

It’s great that it won you over in the end! Would you say it’s a book you’d revisit, or was it a one-time experience?

Title: La Catedral Society Genre: Social Comedy

Synopsis: At La Catedral, an artists’ studio tucked away in the heart of Dublin, the air buzzes with anticipation for the grand Open Day—a rare occasion when the public is invited to step into this world of creatives, visionaries, and a fair share of artistic egos. The night promises to be an unforgettable one, not least because of the fierce rivalry brewing between two leading figures of the studio: the audacious and flamboyant Lucia Sheridan, a conceptual artist renowned for her avant-garde performances (and her tendency to feign fluency in Italian), and the sharp-witted but calculating Maggie "Mapp" Malone, a sculptor whose influence over the studio’s social scene is unparalleled.

Lucia, having felt stifled in her former artistic circles, has recently made La Catedral her new home, determined to become the centerpiece of its social and artistic hierarchy. Maggie, who has long ruled the studio with an iron grip disguised as charm, sees Lucia’s ambitions as a direct threat to her dominance. What begins as a subtle battle of passive-aggressive remarks soon escalates into a full-blown war of artistic sabotage, competitive exhibition placements, and a race to host the most talked-about soirée of the season.

With the Open Day marking the climax of their rivalry, guests—including critics, collectors, and unsuspecting Dubliners—become unwitting pawns in their power struggle. Lucia stages an elaborate multimedia performance to dazzle attendees, while Maggie counters with an exclusive sculpture unveiling that she insists will “redefine the very essence of form.” As the evening progresses, carefully laid plans unravel, with unexpected alliances forming, betrayals being exposed, and a scandalous revelation about one of Dublin’s most revered art patrons throwing the studio into chaos.

Ultimately, amidst the chaos and laughter, the women are forced to recognize their shared need for admiration and control. While neither truly concedes defeat, a begrudging truce is reached—at least until the next exhibition season.

A lively, witty exploration of artistic ambition, social gamesmanship, and the comedy of human nature, La Catedral Society channels the playful rivalry of Mapp and Lucia into a modern-day Dublin art scene, where reputation is everything and creativity is, above all else, a battlefield.

Title: La Catedral Society Genre: Social Comedy

Synopsis: At La Catedral, a vibrant artists’ studio in Dublin, the much-anticipated Open Day is set to be a spectacle of artistic brilliance, social maneuvering, and thinly veiled rivalries. The space hums with creative energy, but beneath the surface lies an intricate battle for influence between two formidable figures—Lucia Sheridan, a flamboyant conceptual artist known for her elaborate performances (and questionable Italian phrases), and Eilish MacPherson, a seasoned sculptor whose grip on the studio’s social hierarchy has remained unchallenged. Until now.

Lucia, new to La Catedral, seeks to make the venue her domain, dazzling visitors and fellow artists with her theatrical presence and grand ideas. Eilish, however, has spent years curating the studio’s elite atmosphere and refuses to be dethroned by this audacious newcomer. Their rivalry, initially subtle, soon explodes into a game of artistic one-upmanship, filled with dramatic exhibition clashes, whispered alliances, and attempts to outshine each other at every turn.

Adding intrigue to the mix is O’Brien, the studio’s doorman, whose unexpectedly vast knowledge of art history makes him a silent but keen observer of the unfolding drama. P.J. Strickland, an eccentric painter with an unpredictable streak, aligns himself with whoever seems most entertaining at the moment. Meanwhile, visiting the studio for the event is Adam Clarke, a celebrated cartoonist whose sharp wit and outsider status allow him to poke fun at the pretensions of the artistic elite while quietly deciding whose company he enjoys most.

As the Open Day reaches its peak, Lucia unveils a theatrical performance piece meant to be her crowning achievement, while Eilish counters with a striking new sculpture designed to capture the crowd’s attention. But neither accounts for the unexpected twists of the evening—an accidental art installation mishap, a scandalous revelation about a prominent Dublin patron, and an impromptu speech from O’Brien that unexpectedly reshapes the social dynamics of La Catedral.

When the dust settles, both women find themselves reevaluating their place in the studio—not as rivals in a battle for dominance, but as figures in an ongoing dance of influence and creativity. The art world never stays static, and neither will La Catedral Society.
