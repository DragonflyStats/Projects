what was the Connaught Rangers mutiny
The Connaught Rangers mutiny occurred in June 1920 in India, when Irish soldiers serving in the British Army protested against British actions in Ireland during the War of Independence. The mutiny began at Wellington Barracks in Jullundur (modern-day Jalandhar) and spread to other locations, including Solan. The soldiers refused to obey orders and declared their support for Irish independence, raising the Irish tricolour and proclaiming their barracks as "Liberty Hall."

The mutiny was suppressed, and several soldiers were killed during the confrontation. Many others were court-martialed, with nineteen sentenced to death (though most sentences were commuted), and others imprisoned. Private James Daly, one of the leaders, was executed for his role in the mutiny, becoming the last member of the British Armed Forces to be executed for mutiny.

The event is remembered as a significant act of defiance against British rule and a demonstration of solidarity with the Irish independence movement. If you'd like to explore more, you can find detailed information here.
