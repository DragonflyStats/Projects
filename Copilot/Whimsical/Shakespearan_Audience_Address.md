Good gentles all, lend me your patient ear, Before the play doth start, some words sincere. Silence thy tongues, and bid thy whispers flee, That all may hear this night’s sweet revelry. If thou dost carry on thy person’s guise A device that rings, with lights that mesmerize, Pray, mute its voice or lay it down to rest, Lest thou disturb the players’ noble quest.

Mark well, this hall hath exits well-displayed, Should need arise, be not of them afraid. On either side, the doors stand open wide, For safe retreat, let these paths be thy guide. And for those needs more humble yet divine, The privies lie nearby—this is their sign: Seek ye the rear, and there shalt thou find Relief that comforts body, heart, and mind.

Show courtesy to neighbors near thy side, For in this house, all souls as one abide. Disturb not the magic, nor break its spell, But journey with us through where dreams may dwell. Now, let the curtain rise, the tale unfold, Be still, be true, and let the night be bold.
