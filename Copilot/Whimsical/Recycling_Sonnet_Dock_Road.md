write a shakespearen sonnet about the recycling drop off point on the Dock road in limerick city
Sure, here's a Shakespearean sonnet in honor of the recycling drop-off point on Dock Road, Limerick City:



Beneath the Dock Road's weary stretch doth lie, A humble place where old lives are reborn; With clang and clamor, heaped materials sigh, And from our homes discarded goods are shorn.

Here, bottles green and papers inked with news, In shining bins and darkened crates reside; All worldly forms, forgotten by their crews, Are sorted, sifted, and reclassified.

O noble site, where waste finds fresh purpose, Thou art the heart of Limerick's green quest; Upon thy grounds, our care and thought immerse, And with each drop, we strive to do our best.

Thus, ‘midst the clink and rustle on this road, Our green ambitions nobly are bestowed.
