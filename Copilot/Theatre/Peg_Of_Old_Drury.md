Herbert Wilcox's *Peg of Old Drury* (1935) is an enchanting historical drama that blends romance, ambition, and theatrical charm. The film centers around the journey of Peg Woffington, a vivacious Irish actress whose life is transformed by heartbreak and triumph on the stage. Inspired by Charles Reade and Tom Taylor's works, this cinematic piece is a tribute to the era's theatrical allure and its remarkable personalities.

Set against the backdrop of 18th-century London, the narrative follows Peg (played by Anna Neagle) as she journeys from Ireland to Drury Lane Theatre. Her idyllic romance with Michael O'Taffe (Jack Hawkins) crumbles early in the film, propelling her into the world of performance.

Wilcox carefully orchestrates an atmosphere of historical authenticity, complemented by the strong performances of its cast. Anna Neagle's portrayal of Peg radiates charisma, capturing both her determination and vulnerability. The supporting cast, including Cedric Hardwicke's rendition of David Garrick and Margaretta Scott as Kitty Clive, enhances the narrative's emotional depth and historical nuances.

While the film’s visual effects and cinematography may appear modest by contemporary standards, they contribute to its charm. The small sets and narrow-focus photography offer an intimate theatrical feel, creating a sense of immersion in Peg's world. The jaunty music score further accentuates the drama's spirited tone, drawing viewers into the highs and lows of her journey.

Beyond its technical aspects, *Peg of Old Drury* is a study of ambition and resilience. Peg’s rise as a celebrated actress symbolizes the era's evolving role of women in the arts—a theme that resonates with audiences even today. Though melodramatic at times, the film successfully captures the essence of Peg's character and her indomitable spirit.

Herbert Wilcox's intention to replicate the success of *Nell Gwynn* (1934) is evident in the casting and production choices. Featuring many of the same leads and technical crew, *Peg of Old Drury* builds on its predecessor's formula, delivering a theatrical romance that balances historical grandeur with heartfelt storytelling.

In conclusion, *Peg of Old Drury* stands as a testament to the golden age of British cinema and the enduring appeal of historical dramas. Peg Woffington’s tale, brought to life by Anna Neagle's brilliant performance, continues to inspire through its portrayal of heartbreak, ambition, and triumph.
