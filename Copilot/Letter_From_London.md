London Attractions:

Millennium Bridge: A walkway bridge across the Thames, leading to the Tate Modern and Shakespeare's Globe Theatre.

Southwark Cathedral: Home to Hodge, an absolute splendid gentleman.

The Kebab Shop: Unquestionably the best kebab shop in London, located on a street called 'The Cost.'

The Old Cheshire Cheese Pub: A historic pub on Fleet Street, frequented by Charles Dickens and Oliver Goldsmith, with an interesting story about a parish from 1929.

Tate Modern:

Many exhibitions are free, but some high-level ones may require payment.

It's a chance to see world-renowned artists' works and cultural exhibits.

Fun fact: It’s the location of the big fight scene between Tom Cruise and Henry Cavill in one of the Mission Impossible movies.

Personal Interest:

Recently saw an excellent exhibition on the Impressionist Art Movement.

Both parents were art teachers, fostering a personal interest in art.

If you know the episode from Blackadder the Third where Blackadder makes up words to antagonize Samuel Johnson, that's the guy behind this story.
