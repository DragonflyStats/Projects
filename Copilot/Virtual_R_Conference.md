### **Virtual Conference Plan**

#### **1. Selection Process:**
- **Abstract Submission:** Speakers submit abstracts for 20 to 30-minute talks. Preference is given to those that can be done online.
- **Program Committee:** The committee selects the most relevant talks.
- **Notification:** Successful speakers are notified to begin preparations.

#### **2. Recording Process:**
- **Pre-Recording:** Speakers pre-record their talks in segments of 4-5 minutes.
- **Recording Tools:** Recommended software includes Zoom and OBS Studio.
- **Editing:** Speakers can use free editing software like DaVinci Resolve or Shotcut for non-commercial use.

#### **3. Quality Assurance:**
- **Speaker Liaison:** A dedicated liaison supervises the recording process and ensures the following:
  - **Technical Quality:** Video and audio quality are assessed.
  - **Visual Consistency:** Text size, graphics clarity, and sound quality are verified.
  - **Closed Captioning:** Closed captions are added to the videos.

#### **4. Publishing:**
- **YouTube Upload:** Completed videos are uploaded to YouTube and released on a scheduled basis.
- **Panel Discussions:** Similar topics are grouped for joint panel discussions using software like OBS Studio and Microsoft Teams.
- **Live Interaction:** Conveners can field relevant questions during these panel discussions.

#### **5. Resource Requirements:**
- **Speaker Liaisons:** A team of liaisons, each managing around five speakers.
- **Internet Access:** Reasonably good internet access for all speakers.
- **Software Mastery:** Speakers should download editing software and learn basic editing techniques.
- **Demonstrations:** Facilitate software demonstrations to help speakers master the tools.

### **Soundtrack:**
To keep the audience engaged, consider curating a soundtrack that plays during breaks or transitions between talks. It adds a professional touch and keeps the energy up throughout the conference.
