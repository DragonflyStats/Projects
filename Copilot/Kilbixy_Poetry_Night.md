Attached is a photo of me and my father outside the Kilbixie Poetry Night, which takes place near our house each year. It’s a lovely local celebration of poetry.

I’ve also included a clipping from The Westmeath Examiner and the article itself. You’ll find a short recording of my father performing his piece.

For my part, I read a poem by Tecla Beer — a distinguished Irish civil servant and academic who once lived in our house as a child — along with a piece inspired by my mother’s visit to her sister, titled Warning.
