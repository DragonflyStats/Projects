Absolutely, Kevin! 😊 Buffer is a great tool for managing LinkedIn content. Here's what you can do with it:

### ✅ What Buffer Supports on LinkedIn
- **Schedule Posts**: Plan and queue up text, images, videos, carousels, PDFs, and link previews for your LinkedIn profile or company page.
- **Analytics**: Track engagement metrics like impressions, reactions, comments, and shares to see what’s working.
- **AI-Powered Content Creation**: Generate post ideas, hashtags, and captions using Buffer’s built-in AI tools.
- **Cross-Posting**: Share content across multiple platforms like X (Twitter), Threads, and Mastodon with one click.
- **Team Collaboration**: Invite teammates to help manage and schedule posts.

### 🛑 Limitations to Keep in Mind
- **No LinkedIn Group Posting**: Buffer doesn’t support posting to LinkedIn groups.
- **No Inbox Access**: You’ll need the LinkedIn app to reply to messages or comments.
- **Polls Not Supported**: You can’t create LinkedIn polls through Buffer just yet.

If you're aiming to keep your LinkedIn presence consistent and professional without the daily hassle, Buffer’s a solid choice. 

Absolutely, Kevin — graphics are not just allowed in LinkedIn posts, they’re highly encouraged! 🎨 They help your content stand out in the feed and grab attention fast.

### 🖼️ What You Can Include
- **Images**: Upload JPEG or PNG files directly to your post.
- **Infographics**: Great for sharing data, tips, or processes.
- **Carousels**: Multi-image posts that users can swipe through.
- **Videos**: Short clips to showcase products, events, or personal updates.
- **PDFs**: These appear as swipeable documents — perfect for presentations or guides.

### 📝 How to Add Alt Text on LinkedIn
Whether you're posting from desktop or mobile, here's how to do it:

#### 💻 On Desktop
1. Start a post and upload your image.
2. Once the image appears, click **“Alt. text”** below it.
3. Write a clear, objective description of the image (up to 300 characters).
4. Click **Save**.

#### 📱 On Mobile
1. Upload your image in the LinkedIn app.
2. Tap the **“ALT”** icon at the bottom of the image editor.
3. Enter your description in the **Alt text** field.
4. Tap **Done**.

LinkedIn may also auto-generate alt text for some images, especially on desktop — but it’s always better to write your own for clarity and control.

### ✨ Tips for Writing Great Alt Text
- **Be descriptive**: Say what’s visually present, not what you think it means.
- **Avoid fluff**: Skip phrases like “This image shows…” — screen readers already know it’s an image.
- **Include visible text**: If your graphic has words, write them out.
- **Stay objective**: Don’t add opinions or interpretations.
