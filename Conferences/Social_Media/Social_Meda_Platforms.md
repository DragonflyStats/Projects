Here's a tidied-up version of your social media inventory text:

**Social Media Inventory**

There are three company pages that are available for use:

1. **R User Community Page**: This page has 19,000 followers. The objective of this page is to promote events and meetups within the R community around the world.
2. **Consortium Page**: This page has approximately 8,000 followers.
3. **User Conference Page**: This page has 5,200 followers.

An announcement post was posted on the R User Community page on July 28th and attracted 5,000 impressions, which is very good.

**Twitter** is no longer functional as a promotional tool. The base is that the blue tick was not purchased, and there is no feasibility for our impression rates that warrants any significant effort. We may still encourage people to promote the conference on their own basis.

Our own impression rates have fallen approximately 8% from two years ago. This is the average number of impressions proposed over a quarter, and it is a waste of time.

We should reactivate the **Blue Sky** account and reconfigure it for 2025 branding. We can begin the policy of active posting on the account to drum up interest. The benefits of an active Blue Sky policy include likely speaker and talk contributions from Blue Sky users, plus the potential to repost other Blue Sky users' content.

Likewise, YouTube has maintained strong engagement despite disaggregated social media habits. I propose to reactivate the **YouTube** channel and have weekly panel discussions and chats. The panel discussion format, with multiple users having a semi-formal discussion, is an optimal strategy. We should also consider hosting webinars.

**Instagram** is massively useful in terms of promoting the conference and attracting speakers and sponsors. It can also provide social coherence to the in-person experience by facilitating people getting to know each other. This should not be underestimated.

My proposed strategy is to reconfigure the **YR Instagram** page, which currently has 298 followers, for this purpose. It can be used to promote social events at the conference and also share stories of people getting to know each other.

Feel free to make any adjustments if necessary! How does that look?
