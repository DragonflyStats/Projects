### Reflections on PyData London Conference  

#### **Disillusionment with the Event**  
I must admit, I’m feeling a bit disillusioned with the PyData London conference. 
It started off well, but with so many people involved, it seems like a classic case of “too many cooks spoil the broth.” 
The marketing campaign has been inconsistent, and as someone without much prior engagement with PyData London, I feel like an outsider.  

Things were progressing smoothly for a while, but then individuals who hadn't been active suddenly appeared and wanted to contribute. 
Their involvement led to changes in the campaign that ultimately seemed ineffective, causing us to lose momentum. 
With only a few weeks left, a small, streamlined team working efficiently to complete major tasks early seems like the best way forward.  

#### **Challenges in Organizing PyData**  
The issue with PyData, in my opinion, is that there’s a layer of people who want to be involved but don’t necessarily know how to contribute constructively. 
While their intentions are good, the sheer number of them creates inefficiencies, turning the process into a disorganized mess. 
It’s almost like an unnecessary layer of buildup—encrusting the machine and making everything sluggish.  

There are many individuals who don’t offer real value but are simply there for free tickets. 
This dilutes the effectiveness of the event organization, making it difficult for meaningful contributions to surface.
