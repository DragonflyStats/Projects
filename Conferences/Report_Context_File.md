Venue
The useR! 2025 conference took place at Duke University, with specific venues including the Penn Pavilion and Gross Hall.

Keynotes
One of the keynotes for the conference was indeed Hadley Wickham. His talk was titled "I wrote this talk with an LLM," and it explored the evolving relationship between data scientists and large language models, showcasing how AI can be a "thought partner" in the R ecosystem.
Hadley Wickham is a well-known figure in the R community. He is the Chief Scientist at Posit, PBC (formerly RStudio) and an adjunct professor at several universities. He is widely recognized for his work on the tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed to make data science easier and more consistent. His contributions include highly popular packages like ggplot2 for data visualization and dplyr for data manipulation. 
His work has had a profound impact on how data analysis is taught and performed using R.
