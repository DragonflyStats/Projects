One idea I'd like to try out is a panel discussion in a Hangout-style YouTube video presentation. This would function as a Q&A about the conference and be approximately 20 minutes long, at most.

The idea is to utilize YouTube as an outreach social media platform. We are doing quite well on LinkedIn, but LinkedIn alone isn't enough. Platforms like Sky and Mastodon are fine but don't have the same reach. Twitter effectively has no reach anymore. Therefore, I propose trying out YouTube to close this gap.

I suggest doing this soon, ideally before the end of February. This would give people plenty of warning in advance of the CFP (Call for Papers) closure and help drum up interest in sponsorship.
