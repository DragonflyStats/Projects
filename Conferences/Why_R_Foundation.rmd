During the COVID period, the foundation was very active, hosting a series of webinars. Prior to that, there were several conferences in Poland, with the last in-person Polish conference taking place in November 2019.

It had been envisaged that the YR Foundation would wind down completely, and it has now formally ceased as a legal entity in Poland. However, the brand still exists.

The current consensus is to integrate it into the broader R community framework. There are three key digital assets:

LinkedIn Page: Still actively used to promote community information. It functions as a subsidiary to the REUS community LinkedIn page.

Facebook Page: Currently inactive, but based on experience with Pi Day, itâ€™s a useful tool for event promotion and paid campaigns.

YouTube Channel: Has a substantial following and could be revitalized.

It would be advisable to recruit someone to restart the webinar series on an ongoing basis and use YR as a promotional tool for the general R community and for useR!, operating entirely in a digital format.
