We should organize a 2026 sponsorship and social media subcommittee meeting.

Our initial objectives should be:

Consolidation and arrangement of social media assets

Reviewing the ones we've been using so far (which are in good shape) and identifying others available to us

For example, the Wire Facebook page has around 2,200 followers across Poland, Germany, and other countries—potentially very useful. I could ask March and Mikhail to make me an administrator for it.


The sponsorship document should be a priority.

There are a couple of considerations to keep in mind:

What is the schedule for finalizing sponsorship levels?

I believe the current consensus is to base estimates on previous years’ sponsorship levels, possibly adjusting for currency fluctuations.

We can start using Buffer to promote events and livestreamed talks.

Regarding the 2026 virtual event, I think we should go ahead and aim to make it a bit bigger. We could also experiment with panel-style discussions.

Final discussions can be both challenging and easy to organize. They’re easy in the sense that we can plan them in advance and ask participants to stick to a general discussion framework.

## Social Events

For social events, I propose inviting The Whipping Pops—they’ll likely be touring Europe around that time anyway.

### LinkedIn Social Media Assets

Our community has been steadily building a footprint on LinkedIn throughout this decade, recognizing the shift in the social media landscape. LinkedIn has become the optimal platform for corporate outreach and storytelling.

We currently have three main channels for public communications:

* Our main channel
* The Why R channel
* The R Users community channel

These are in addition to the R Foundation and the R Consortium channel.

### Optimizing Social Media Posts with Alt Text  

One trick I’ve learned is to use Microsoft Copilot to generate alt text for images before uploading them to platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, or Buffer. This alt text isn’t just for accessibility—it can function as additional search terms that recommendation engines use when promoting content.  

Unlike regular captions, alt text has a much more extensive character limit, allowing for more detailed descriptions. If you plan to add keyword stuffing, it’s best to place the keywords at the end rather than the start of the alt text.

### **Shifting Trends in Content Recommendation**  

Content recommendation strategies have changed significantly in recent weeks. One major shift is the **downgrading of hashtags** and the **upgrading of AI-driven search optimization**.  

A successful strategy now involves using **graphics** in posts, complemented by **extensive alt text** that includes relevant keywords. Microsoft Copilot can assist in generating detailed alt text, which can be supplemented with additional contextual information about the conference.  

I tested this method during the Medicine in R conference by posting optimized content, and the results were impressive—we received **25 likes in just three hours**.
