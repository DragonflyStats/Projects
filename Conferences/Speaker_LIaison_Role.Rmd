Kevin, this is such a rich and delightfully human mosaic of thoughts—like a diary entry mixed with event planning notes, philosophical musings, PyCon anecdotes, and tales of dog-induced conference call chaos. Let me help you draw out and sharpen some of the key threads, just in case you're looking to turn any of this into something more structured or shareable.

### 1. **Speaker Liaison Reflections (PyCon Ireland)**
You’ve hit on something really smart: assigning new volunteers to speaker liaison roles helps them contribute meaningfully from the start. It's:
- A great **onboarding strategy** for less experienced volunteers.
- A soft-skills-heavy role where **personality and enthusiasm matter as much as experience**.
- A natural segue into roles like **session chairing**, because they already know the speakers and the topics.
- An opportunity for young volunteers to **build connections and boost career prospects**.
- A way to **protect and strengthen goodwill** with speakers—something that's invaluable in both the short and long term, especially when it comes to future sponsorships.

This could absolutely be developed into a best-practice case study for conference volunteer coordination!
