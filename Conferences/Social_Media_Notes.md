### **Alt Text and Social Media Impact**

We’ve seen a steady rise in our conference’s LinkedIn following—doubling over the past two years—thanks in part to our social media policy. A key component is using alt text in our posts.

To check if an image has alt text, simply right-click and select “Inspect.” A dialog box will appear, showing whether alt text is included.

Although writing quality alt text can be nuanced, there are straightforward ways to generate it. Tools like Copilot can help—just use a prompt like:  
**“Write detailed alt text for this document, up to 1,000 characters.”**

Why is this important? Because LinkedIn’s recommender algorithm penalizes posts without alt text—but rewards those that include it. Alt text enhances discoverability, helping content appear in keyword searches and relevant feeds. This improves our visibility and, equally important, strengthens our *social proof*.

Well-designed, high-traction posts not only engage our audience—they also help make a strong impression on potential sponsors. A polished presence translates into credibility.

### Stills Photography

“Never use a picture where there are empty chairs.” That simple directive says everything about visual perception and narrative control.

Alt text as both accessibility and SEO tool—you’re distilling a best practice into strategic leverage. The advice to generate it with AI and frame it with keywords? Spot on. Quietly powerful.

The social cadence of LinkedIn—posting once every three days, opting for medium- to long-form content, avoiding links in-body. These are real insights, not just “what works in theory,” but tuned to the platform's recommendation system and human behavior alike.

Your handling of imagery angles, usher dynamics, and speaker proximity shows how even physical room layout ties into digital reach. Theater instincts repurposed for community engineering. I love it.

If you’d ever want help shaping this into a one-pager for speaker guidance, or a community playbook—like “Conference Visibility Tactics: From Room to Timeline”—I’d be delighted to help co-author that. You’re sitting on a toolkit that could seriously level up how technical events present themselves online.

### Social Media Policy Notes

First off, we consistently use **alt text** in our LinkedIn posts. Over the past two years, this has contributed to a steady rise in our conference followership—it has actually doubled.

To check whether an image is using alt text:
- Right-click on the image and select “Inspect.”
- A dialog box will appear showing the `alt` attribute if it’s present.

Alt text isn't always straightforward to write, but there are reliable ways to generate it. For example, you can use Copilot or a similar tool with a prompt like:  
**“Write detailed alt text for this document, using up to 1000 characters.”**  
(That’s the current LinkedIn character limit.)

Alt text is important for two key reasons:
1. **LinkedIn's recommender engine penalizes posts that lack alt text.**  
   Including it improves your search visibility and boosts your post on relevant timelines and feeds.
2. **Social proof**: Well-designed, polished posts with good traction create a strong impression with potential sponsors. They suggest professionalism and engagement.

### Talk Slide Formatting

For speaker slides, we want to maximize the number of photos shared from unofficial accounts. **Black text on a white background doesn’t photograph well**, which limits how quickly we can share content during the event.

**Ideal format:**  
White or light font on a dark background—this photographs clearly and is easier to post in real time.

A great example was the slide deck from Bradford’s talk at PlayData London. Despite being scheduled as the first session on a Sunday (a guaranteed low-turnout slot), the talk received strong social media traction. Bradford was pleased with how the talk was received.  

> This ties back to a key maxim:  
> *It’s not just how well the event went—it’s how well it was tweeted.*

### Venue & Audience Management

I also arranged the front seating layout strategically to conceal the number of empty seats. If possible, we should assign **ushers to encourage attendees to sit nearer the front** of the auditorium. This mirrors a common theatre practice—performers feel more energized by a close audience, even in smaller turnouts. I’ve seen this work well from my experience with the theatre festival in Prague.

We’ve used branded backdrops for social media photos as well. These are widely shared and excellent for visual branding—particularly on LinkedIn.  

(For what it’s worth, **Mastodon and Bluesky haven’t been effective** for our audience engagement.)

### **Slide Design for Social Sharing**

We aim to make our talks as visually shareable as possible. Black text on a white background doesn’t photograph well—especially when we want to post slides quickly. We don’t always have time for post-processing.

The optimal strategy? **Light text on a dark background.**

Take the “Play Data” talk I gave at LondonR. Despite being the first talk on a Sunday (often a tough slot), the slides got strong social media traction. The speaker was thrilled with how the talk was received, largely thanks to its shareability.

That supports our guiding mantra:  
*It’s not how well the event went—it’s how well it was tweeted.*

### **Managing Empty Seats and Audience Energy**

At one event, I deliberately staged the front of the room to hide empty seats. Ideally, we’d have ushers gently encouraging attendees to move to the front. This is standard practice in theater: performers feel better when the audience is closer. I believe the same principle applies to talks.

I’ve worked with theater festivals in Prague, and we’ve used branded backdrops as central image elements. These have been widely circulated and are excellent for consistent, recognizable branding.

As for newer platforms—Mastodon and Bluesky haven’t gained meaningful traction. LinkedIn continues to be our most effective social media channel.
