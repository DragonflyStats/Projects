### **Alt Text and Social Media Impact**

We’ve seen a steady rise in our conference’s LinkedIn following—doubling over the past two years—thanks in part to our social media policy. A key component is using alt text in our posts.

To check if an image has alt text, simply right-click and select “Inspect.” A dialog box will appear, showing whether alt text is included.

Although writing quality alt text can be nuanced, there are straightforward ways to generate it. Tools like Copilot can help—just use a prompt like:  
**“Write detailed alt text for this document, up to 1,000 characters.”**

Why is this important? Because LinkedIn’s recommender algorithm penalizes posts without alt text—but rewards those that include it. Alt text enhances discoverability, helping content appear in keyword searches and relevant feeds. This improves our visibility and, equally important, strengthens our *social proof*.

Well-designed, high-traction posts not only engage our audience—they also help make a strong impression on potential sponsors. A polished presence translates into credibility.

### **Slide Design for Social Sharing**

We aim to make our talks as visually shareable as possible. Black text on a white background doesn’t photograph well—especially when we want to post slides quickly. We don’t always have time for post-processing.

The optimal strategy? **Light text on a dark background.**

Take the “Play Data” talk I gave at LondonR. Despite being the first talk on a Sunday (often a tough slot), the slides got strong social media traction. The speaker was thrilled with how the talk was received, largely thanks to its shareability.

That supports our guiding mantra:  
*It’s not how well the event went—it’s how well it was tweeted.*

### **Managing Empty Seats and Audience Energy**

At one event, I deliberately staged the front of the room to hide empty seats. Ideally, we’d have ushers gently encouraging attendees to move to the front. This is standard practice in theater: performers feel better when the audience is closer. I believe the same principle applies to talks.

I’ve worked with theater festivals in Prague, and we’ve used branded backdrops as central image elements. These have been widely circulated and are excellent for consistent, recognizable branding.

As for newer platforms—Mastodon and Bluesky haven’t gained meaningful traction. LinkedIn continues to be our most effective social media channel.
