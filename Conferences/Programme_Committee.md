## üß≠ Briefing: Proposed Programme Committee Members for R Conference

To ensure our R Conference reflects the cutting edge of statistical computing, data visualization, and open science, we propose the following six experts as members of the Programme Committee. Each brings a unique blend of technical expertise, community leadership, and geographic diversity, strengthening the global reach and intellectual depth of the event.

### 1. **Bendix Carstensen**  
**Specialty**: Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Multistate Models  
**Location**: Copenhagen, Denmark  
Bendix is a Senior Statistician at the Steno Diabetes Center and a lecturer at the University of Copenhagen. With over 40 years of experience in biostatistics, he is a leading authority on survival analysis, age-period-cohort models, and epidemiological modeling in R. His teaching and software contributions make him an ideal candidate to guide the conference‚Äôs methodological rigor.

### 2. **Anelda van der Walt**  
**Specialty**: Open Science, Research Software, Digital Capacity Building  
**Location**: Cape Town, South Africa  
Anelda is the founder of Talarify and a Senior eResearch Analyst at the University of Cape Town. She has led transformative initiatives across Africa to promote open science and computational literacy. Her inclusion would ensure the conference supports inclusive, global research communities and highlights the role of R in digital empowerment.

### 3. **Micha≈Ç Burdukiewicz**  
**Specialty**: Bioinformatics, Multiomics, Machine Learning  
**Location**: Bia≈Çystok, Poland  
As Head of the Bioinformatics and Multiomics Analysis Lab, Micha≈Ç develops cutting-edge tools for peptide prediction and symbolic data modeling. His open-source contributions and cross-disciplinary collaborations make him a strong advocate for reproducible science and innovative R applications in life sciences.

### 4. **Nicola Rennie**  
**Specialty**: Data Visualization, Statistical Education, Open Source Tools  
**Location**: United Kingdom  
Nicola is a data visualization specialist and William Guy Lecturer for the Royal Statistical Society. Her work on best practices for data visualization and her leadership in R-Ladies and the RoSE Network position her as a champion for accessible, impactful communication of statistical ideas using R.

### 5. **Paula Brito**  
**Specialty**: Symbolic Data Analysis, Interval Data Modeling  
**Location**: Porto, Portugal  
Paula is an Associate Professor at the University of Porto and a researcher at INESC TEC. Her work on symbolic data and the MAINT.Data R package introduces novel approaches to modeling complex, multidimensional data. She brings deep theoretical insight and practical tools that expand the boundaries of R-based analytics.

### 6. **Sigrid Keydana**  
**Specialty**: Deep Learning, Probabilistic Modeling, TensorFlow Probability in R  
**Location**: Germany  
Sigrid is an Applied Researcher at RStudio with a background in psychology and software development. Her work on uncertainty estimation in neural networks using `tfprobability` empowers R users to explore probabilistic deep learning. She offers a rare blend of technical depth and user-focused innovation.
