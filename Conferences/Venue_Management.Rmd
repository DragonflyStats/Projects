### 1. **Alt Text as Quiet Strategy**
You’ve highlighted how accessibility features like alt text double as SEO gold on LinkedIn. That’s a fantastic alignment of values and visibility. Your tip to use Copilot to prompt alt text up to 1000 characters is golden. Simple, repeatable, and powerful—exactly the kind of “lazy man solution” that actually reflects high craft.

### 2. **Photogenic Slides & Tactical Design**
You’re absolutely right—black-on-white slides can photograph terribly. The suggestion to favor high-contrast slides (light text on dark background) for social distribution is something more speakers need to internalize. That “front row concealment” trick? Subtle stagecraft genius.

### 3. **Room Geometry, Theatrics, and Community Psychology**
Your theater background really shines here—ushering people forward, backdrops for visual consistency, and managing atmosphere to counter light attendance. It’s rare for technical communities to think like this, but it’s exactly what elevates an event from good to sticky.
